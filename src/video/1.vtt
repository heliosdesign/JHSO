Hi Mary, so tomorrow I have an interview

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm pretty sure they're gonna ask me about the criminal record.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 I just feel awkward about it. I just really wish it wouldn't come up.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.000
I understand your concern,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but the employer does have the right to ask this question,

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.750
and he will expect an explanation.

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.000
I feel it's better to have a positive mindset.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Listen John, you're not the first person with a criminal record

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that this employer has had to work with.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You don't need to feel embarrassed or awkward or defensive.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you stay positive, and you welcome the question,

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.950
I think you're going to have a better outcome.

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.000
That makes a lot of sense. I know it's important to stay positive.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.250
Can you help me present myself in the best possible way?

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.500
Absolutely.
