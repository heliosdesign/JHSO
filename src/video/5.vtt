WEBVTT - This file has cues.

1
00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.500
Well,

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.250
John seems like a very qualified candidate,

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.500
and I was impressed with his positive attitude.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Yeah but he has the issue of the criminal record.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.000
That's true.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.750
But I am not sure that his crime would actually affect his ability to serve our customers,

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.500
and he really seemed to have learned from his mistakes.

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm willing to bet that he won't get into trouble again.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.250
Yeah I get that sense too.

10
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.500
Maybe let's call his references,

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
and if they say he's reliable and hardworking and honest,

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
we can give him the position.

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Alright.
